Introduction

General Research Question:

My project aims to investigate the influence of gender and parental separation on students' alcohol consumption and its subsequent impact on their academic performance. Specifically, I will explore:

Differences in alcohol consumption among male and female students based on their parents' cohabitation status.

The relationship between alcohol consumption and academic grades.

Data Source: 

The dataset for this analysis is from Kaggle, titled "Student Alcohol Data". It can be accessed at Kaggle: Student Alcohol Data.

The data set is part of a larger study conducted by Paulo Cortez, which involved surveying students about various aspects of their school life, personal habits, and family background. The data collection method is survey-based, targeting students attending secondary education in Portugal.

Variables:

school: Student's school (GP - Gabriel Pereira or MS - Mousinho da Silveira).

sex: Student's gender (F - Female, M - Male).

age: Age of the student (numeric: from 15 to 22).

address: Type of student's home address (U - Urban, R - Rural).

famsize: Family size (LE3 - Less or equal to 3, GT3 - Greater than 3).

Pstatus: Parents' cohabitation status (T - Living together, A - Apart).

Medu/Fedu: Mother's/Father's education level (numeric: 0 - None, 1 - Primary education (4th grade), 2 – 5th to 9th grade, 3 – Secondary education, 4 – Higher education).

Mjob/Fjob: Mother's/Father's job (Teacher, Health, Services, At_home, Other).

reason: Reason for choosing the school (Home proximity, School reputation, Course preference, Other).

guardian: Student's guardian (Mother, Father, Other).

traveltime/studytime: Travel time to school/Weekly study time (numeric categories).

failures: Number of past class failures (numeric).

schoolsup/famsup/paid: School support/Family support/Paid classes (Yes, No).

activities/nursery/higher/internet/romantic: Extracurricular activities, Nursery school attendance, Desire for higher education, Internet access, Romantic relationship (Yes, No).

famrel/freetime/goout/Dalc/Walc/health: Quality of family relationships, Free time, Going out with friends, Workday/Weekend alcohol consumption, Health status (numeric scales).

absences: Number of school absences (numeric).

G1/G2/G3: First period/Second period/Final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20).

Data

A README file has been added to the /data folder. This README includes:

Dimensions of the Dataset: The total number of rows (observations) and columns (variables).

Codebook: A brief description of each variable in the dataset, as outlined in Section 1.

Data Analysis Plan

Outcome Variable (Y): The primary outcome variable will be the students' final grades (G3). This reflects their overall academic performance.

Predictor Variables (X):

Alcohol Consumption: Both workday (Dalc) and weekend (Walc) alcohol consumption levels.

Parental Cohabitation Status: The status of parents living together (Pstatus = 'T') or apart (Pstatus = 'A').

Gender: Student's gender (sex), categorized as male (M) and female (F).

Comparison Groups

The analysis will focus on two main comparison groups:

By Gender: Comparing male and female students to observe differences in alcohol consumption patterns.

By Parental Status: Examining differences in students' alcohol consumption and academic performance based on whether their parents live together or apart.

Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary Statistics: Basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) for the main variables (grades, alcohol consumption).

Visualizations:

Histograms to display the distribution of grades and alcohol consumption.

Scatter plots to observe potential relationships between alcohol consumption and grades.

This analysis will help identify trends, outliers, and patterns in the data, providing insights into the relationships between the variables.

{r}Copy code

# Sample code for preliminary exploratory analysis
# Histogram of final grades
ggplot(student_data, aes(x = G3)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

# Scatter plot of workday alcohol consumption vs. final grades
ggplot(student_data, aes(x = Dalc, y = G3)) + geom_point()


Proposed Methods

Regression Analysis: To examine the relationship between alcohol consumption (Dalc, Walc) and academic performance (G3), adjusting for gender and parental status.

Group Comparisons: T-tests or ANOVA to compare grades and alcohol consumption across different groups (based on gender and parental status).

Expected Results to Support Hypotheses

From Regression Analysis: A negative correlation between high levels of alcohol consumption and academic grades.

From Group Comparisons: Significant differences in alcohol consumption patterns and academic performance based on gender and parental cohabitation status.

The results will be interpreted to understand the impact of gender and parental separation on students' alcohol habits and their academic outcomes.
